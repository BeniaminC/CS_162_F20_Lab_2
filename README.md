# CS_162_F20_Lab_2

Important concepts to understand by the end of this lab:

- stream objects (ostream, istream, and fstream objects)
- input file streams (insertion operator)
- output file streams (extraction operator)
- both input and output file stream
- cursor manipulation
- flags
- binary operator
- stream member functions (using them to parse through the file)
- getline (why it's sometimes necessary)
- passing stream objects by reference

not covered in this code
- sorting algorithms
- tar files

NOTE: Some concepts may be extensions to lectures and labs (i.e. modern style C++ programming).
