# CS_162_F20_Lab_2

Important concepts to understand by the end of this lab:

- stream objects (ofstream, ifstream, and fstream objects)
- input file operators (insertion operator and extraction operato)
- both input and output file stream
- cursor manipulation
- flags (input, output, and appending are most important)
- binary operator (combining flags)
- stream member functions (using them for loops)
- getline (why it's sometimes necessary to tokenize)
- passing stream objects by reference to functions (why that is important)

not covered in this code
- sorting algorithms
- tar files
